This directory contains software tools for configuring the Cornell WFDs

We use IPbus for communication with the WFDs:
   svnweb.cern.ch/trac/cactus/wiki

To build all the code:
   1. edit setenv.sh (if necessary) to point to your cactus IPbus installation
   2. edit Makefile (if necessary) to point to your cactus IPbus installation
   3. source setenv.sh
   4. type "make" in the base directory

The result of the "make" command should be
   1. "obj" directory containing object (.o) and dependency (.d) files for
      each C++ file
   2. "lib" directory containing the shared library (.so) file for the
      CornellWFDTool classes
   3. "bin" directory containing executables

So far we have only implemented executables for updating the firmware bitstreams
stored in the flash memory chip of the WFDs.

The master bitstream is stored at address 0x0 in the flash
The channel bitstream is stored at address 0xCE0000
(These addresses are hardcoded in the firmware and in the C++ code)

Usage:

    programMasterFirmware connectionFileName.xml mcsFileName.mcs
    programChannelFirmware connectionFileName.xml mcsFileName.mcs

For now we are still using Python scripts for other configuration tasks.
We plan to add more functionality to the C++ CornellWFDTool code in the future.

The "connection" directory contains the WFD address table and an example
connection file.
