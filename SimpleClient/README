Instructions for SimpleClient (copied from Dan's email)

Now you can start the AMC13Tool and get data flowing.
run AMC13Tool with the arguments "-u -n XX" where XX is the serial number on the AMC13 card

Here are some basic commands to get the AMC13 card to generate data
     rg
     wv 0x1 0x0
     wv 0x3 0x1fff
     wv 0x1 0x187
     wv 0x1c 0x80008000
     wv 0x0 0x10
     wv 0x0 0x1

     start the simple client now! (The first SFP should be 192.168.1.32)

     wv 0x0 0x4000000  (starts the data flow)
     wv 0x0 0x400  (stops the data flow)

This will take data from the AMC13 at about 29MBps.

While it is running, you can step down the value in the lowest 16bits of 0x1c by factors of two to increase the data rate by factors of two.
So "wv 0x1c 0x80004000" should double the data rate from the AMC13.
